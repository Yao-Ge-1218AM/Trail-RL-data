I called the patient for follow-up and he reported of 6  episode of vomiting in the evening of 4/2 after he received the PRGN 2009 vaccine and pembrolizumab.  Since then he has had intermittent  fever (99.6-100.8) which he has been taking tylenol  with some relief. He has had increase heart rate and low blood pressure, fatigue , nausea, decrease appetite & body aches. He attributed the headaches  to trigeminal neuralgia and symptoms are not different or worse.
He denies any diarrhea, abdominal pain, visual changes, chest pain, dyspnea or dizziness. He stated that his blood pressure was low upon awakening this morning @ 8 am 86//59 with HR of 133. I asked him to recheck his blood pressure while I was talking to him on the phone, 128/75 and pulse of 110. He said that his symptoms are slowly getting better compared to yesterday. 
 I explained to him that his symptoms are likely  due to his immune system reacting to the vaccine and / or drug. He should continue to hydrate, eat small frequent meals and take tylenol as needed for fever. I instructed him to call us if symptoms worsens. He has  DH phone number in the event that he needs medical evaluation on weekends or after hours. He verbalized understanding.

CT NECK 3/28/2025 

FINDINGS:
The exam is mildly limited by motion artifact.
Beam-hardening artifact from dental hardware limits evaluation of the oral cavity.
Mucoperiosteal thickening and fluid in the maxillary sinuses is slightly improved.
Intracranial atherosclerosis.
Again seen is a lobulated enhancing mass centered in the left tonsil, which is difficult to accurately measure
due to its infiltrative and lobular configuration. The overall disease burden, however, appears improved since
prior exam. The craniocaudal extent of the pharyngeal portion of the mass is slightly smaller (7.6 cm) (series
3, image 105). There is persistent involvement of the tongue base, lateral pharyngeal wall, and left
parapharyngeal space. Portions of the lesion abut the sternocleidomastoid and submandibular gland.
The extent of necrotic adenopathy has also improved, for example (3.5 cm x 2.5 cm) (series 5, image 138),
and the effacement of the left jugular vein has also improved. Many of the other necrotic lymph nodes have
also slightly decreased in size, and involve both sides of the neck, for example (2.4 cm x 1.8 cm) (series 5,
image 85).
Chest findings have been reported previously.



IMPRESSION: 
 
Overall, improving disease burden, with slightly decreased size of 
the infiltrative enhancing mass centered in the region of the left 
tonsil, in keeping with provided history of malignancy. The extent of 
necrotic adenopathy has also improved, with decreasing size of these 
lymph nodes, although significant adenopathy remains. 



End of Visit: 
Assessment: 52 y/o male with newly diagnosed HPV associated T4N2 stage lll SCC of oropharynx ( left tonsil ) presenting for 30 day safety visit on protocol 001536. Patient continues to receive SOC treatment with chemoRT at INOVA. He is currently on week 5 of XRTat INOVA and reports treatment related toxicities such as stomatitis, xerostomia, itching, pain around mouth that is well controlled by supportive therapies.   He initially reported a skin rash of his chest wall posteriorly on right that has now fully resolved. No fever or chills or other systemic symptoms related to the vaccine. He will continue to follow up at INOVA for SOC. Research nurse will follow up with him on the phone every 6 months for survival check.	
Plan: #H&N SCC - STARTED radiation 3/31 along with weekly chemotherapy, currently on week 5 -- C1D1 on 3/14/2025: received PRGN-2009 5x10^11 (5E11) VP SC then, Pembrolizumab 200mg IVx1 --received PRGN-2009 5x10^11 VP SC, on week 3 of protocol 001536 03/25/25 --patient tolerated treatment well overall --CT Neck 3/28/2025 done showed some improvement of cervical lesions but more time is needed to determine full benefit --patient seen at 30 days safety visit today and overall did not reports toxicities due to trial drugs. Has ongoing side effect of stomatitis, neck discomfort related to XRT --Patient will contnue SOC ChemoRT at INOVA with primar team --research nurse to follow patient periodically for survival checks q6 months on the phone.     #Rash - Likely immune checkpoint inhibitor related rash, resolved.   #Transaminitis, resolved  -Present at baseline, likely secondary to Tylenol, ETOH, supplement use. Advised avoiding all the above. -No concern for hepatitis, biliary obstruction or metastasis.  -Labs done 4/29/2025 showed LFT WNL.    Patient discussed and seen with Dr. Floudas

 History of Present Illness:
 Mr. NAME is a 57 y/o male with recent diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the base of the tongue, Stage II T3N2M0.  He was noted to have enlarged cervical lymph node during an evaluation for inguinal hernia by Dr. Scriven. He underwent FNA of left cervical lymph node on 8/20/2024 which showed squamous cell carcinoma with negative immunostaining for p16. PET/ CT scan on 8/28/2024 showed locally advanced hypermetabolic mass centered base of tongue extending to the left vallecula/piriform sinus measuring 2.1 X 2.2 X2.7 cm, SUV 19.6, approaching & likely crossing midline in the pre-epiglottic space with b/l multilevel metastatic cervical nodes; enlarge thyroid with heterogenous diffuse hypermetabolism c/w inflammation; No evidence of distant metastatic disease.
Underwent tongue biopsy on 9/12 without complications with pathology confirming +p16.  Received week 1 treatment (pembro + PRGN-2009 vaccine) on 9/13/24 and tolerated well overall, other than some mild left arm soreness, as well as one day of generalized achiness and fatigue. Received 2nd dose of vaccine on 10/1/24. Again, had some fatigue and joint aches, which seem to be improving. Repeat BOT biopsy done this morning. Here for end of treatment visit.

 Assessment and Plan:
Assessment: Mr. NAME is a 57 y/o male with newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the base of the tongue, Stage II T3N2M0 currently enrolled in 001536-C: Phase II Trial of Immunotherapeutic HPV Vaccine PRGN-2009 with Pembrolizumab before Standard Treatment in Subjects with Newly Diagnosed HPV-Associated Oropharyngeal. 	
Plan:  # HNSCC -Underwent tongue biopsy on 9/12 per protocol.  -Week 1 treatment with Pembrolizumab and PRGN-2009 vaccine completed 9/13/24 -Week 3 treatment was 10/1/24, with PRGN-2009 vaccine. - Biopsy #2 and completion/EOT clinic visit today, 10/3/24.  -Plan to begin SOC radiation with radio-sensitizing chemotherapy next week.   # Subclinical hyperthyroidism (in the setting of recent ICI) -Screening CT neck demonstrated large thyroid nodules. Had follow up thyroid ultrasound completed at INOVA. -TSH on 10/1/24 noted to be <0.01, free T4 1.8.   -Endocrinology was consulted (see 10/1 consult note) and felt that this was most consistent with ICI related thyroiditis and recommended repeat thyroid studies in 2-3 weeks, to include TSH, free T4 and total T3. Also recommended a beta blocker should he become symptomatic. If he continues to be hyperthyroid after 2-3 weeks, they recommended that a RAI uptake scan be performed.  -Outside thyroid ultrasound was reviewed, and thyroid nodules did not meet criteria for FNA and a repeat u/s in 1 year was recommended.  -Patient remains asymptomatic without tachycardia, tremors, palpitations or other symptoms. He has established care with endocrinology at INOVA and knows he will need repeat labs in 2-3 weeks.
